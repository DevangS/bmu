bmu(bash me up) v0.2 includes:
- bmub: backup script to compress current directory's files and email
- bmuc: conversion script to convert DOS files to Unix

Note to users: 
You may need to convert each file to the proper formatting. You can run bmuc,
but since this is a chicken and egg sort of problem, here is the script on a
single line to run: 

for i in $(ls); do awk '{ sub("\r$", ""); print }' $i > $i; done
